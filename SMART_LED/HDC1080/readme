I2C address : 100 0000 (7-bit address)

/!\ Registers from 0x03 to 0xFA are reserved : not to be written

STEPS TO PERFORM AQUISITION :

1) Configure acquisition parameters in register 0x02
	a. both temperature & HR : Bit[12] to 1
	b. temperature resolution : Bit[10] to 0( 14-bit) or 1 (11_bit)
	c. HR resolution : Bit[9:8] to 00 (14-bit) or 01 (11-bit) or 10 (8-bit)

2) Trigger measurements by executing a pointer write transaction with the address pointer set to 0x00

3) Wait for the measurements to complete

4) Read the output data from register 0x00 (temperature) followed by 0x01 (HR)
